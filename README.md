This is the Mini Modpon controller which runs an Arduino Nano controller

This tiny controller simply turns a 3-5v pump on and off. The duration of the times is set in the Arduino code. By default the pump will turn on every hour for 1 minute. You can modify this if you need to by connecting the controller to your pc.

Perfect for small setups like the window bottle stand.
